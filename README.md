# Operator Room

## What is this about?
The operator room is the control center of the escape room. It's a separate room where the operator (game master) is taking place to observe the happenings in the escape room.
The operator room supports functionality to control, monitor and trace the events of the room. It also provides mechanisms to display hints to the visitors.

Another purpose of the operator room is to centralize the communication of all involved systems. It serves as a kind of server room which provides an interface for all systems to communicate with each other. It also controls the game workflow.   
## Components
The requirements of the system can be devided into three abstract components.

### Monitoring
The monitoring serves as feedback for the operator (game master) to observe the visitors. This is for ex. camaras or microphones.

***Implementation:*** The **UI control board** is implemented as a web application. It provides following features:

  1. Camera integration
  2. Game state displaying
  3. UI for state controlling (ex. reset, start, step backâ€¦)

### Communication
The communication interface allows the participated systems to exchange messages and transit a the game states (ex. if a puzzle is solved).

***Implementation:*** The communication framework and game interface consist of two modules.

  1. Centralized and standardized interface for inter mc communication (simple way to send message to other mcs)
  2. Interface for workflow feedback and state changes (ex. puzzle solved)
   
### Game logic
The game logic is an automaton which controls the game states and their transistions. It applies

## General architecture
The following picture shows the general architecture according to the introduced three components. The diagram consists of four packages. There is a PC with in Browser in the "Operator room" and multiple cameras ("ESP cams") and micro computers (MCs) accessing the "Operator System". The "Operator System" consists the three components.

Moreover the digramm specifies the communication protocols between the components.
